	<p>Robert Kirk was born in the great state of Texas. He was born with his brother and sister. Yes he is a triplet, and yes he is the most adorable of the lot.</p>
	<p>He has distiguished himself from his family by living abroad in Japan. He has also obtained a black belt in Taekwondo. He is also looking forward to learning more martial arts including but not limited to aikido and iaido. But nothing compares to his desire to learn to code.</p>
